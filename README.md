This is a new React Native Project for Modak to list Products, sort by ranking and prices, filter by categories, add a product purchase reminder and deeplink for categories bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

## RN instalation

npx @react-native-community/cli init MyPipCustom --version 0.78.0-rc.1

I used this react native version (0.78) because the latest version (0.81) has issues with the navigation library

## Node version

20.17.0

## Step 1: Start Metro

Install Components and Libraries

```sh
# Using npm
npm install
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npx react-native run-android

```

## Deeplink Test

You can use those URL from your devices notes or whatsapp to test the deepLinks:

For category:
https://modak.challenge.com/category/furniture

For a specific product
https://modak.challenge.com/product/2
